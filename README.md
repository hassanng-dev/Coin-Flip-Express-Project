Test your luck! In this project i've made a coin flip game. You are able to choose either heads or tails. After you've submitted your guess you are given a result whether the coin landed on heads or tails and you are then notified if you've won or loss!

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. Javascript was used to add the logic behind the results of the coin flip. I used various methods to determine whether the coin landed on heads or tails. After the result is determined you are then told whether your luck was on your side with a message of "You've Won!" or "You've Lost". In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because a childhood game was always game of probability. This inspired me to relive my childhood throughout this project.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
